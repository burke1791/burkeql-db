# Fill and Defill

In this section, we're going to update our code to actually insert our new data, and we'll finally be able to test it out by running some insert statements.

Let's pretend we're an insert statement being shuffled along our program's insert code path and make the necessary changes as we find them. Starting at the top, our main function requests input from the user and sends it through the parser. Processing the parse tree is where we come in:

`src/main.c`
